# EmojiArt
Hi !
This program is an artistic project, it transform images from video camera into emojis.
The program convert a list of emoji into an image and calculate their average color value.
Then the for every pixels of the video camera, the program is taking the color value and searching into the list of emoji to find the closest value and replace the pixel by the emoji.
